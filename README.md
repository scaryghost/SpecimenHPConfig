Specimen Health Configuration

##Install
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.  Mutator name is:

    SpecimenHPConfig.SpecimenHPConfigMut

##Usage
Set the minNumPlayers variable to whatever number you want between 1-6.  The mutator will then scale every specimen's hp to that player count, regardless of how many living players there are.  If the count is less than the number of living players, the mutator will not alter the specimen's hp.
