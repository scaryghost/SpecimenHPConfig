Install:
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
Set the minNumPlayers variable to whatever number you want between 1-100.  
The mutator will then scale every specimen's hp to that player count, 
regardless of how many living players there are.  If the count is less than 
the number of living players, the hp will instead scale to the number of 
living players.
