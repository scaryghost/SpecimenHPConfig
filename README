Install:
Copy the contents in the system folder to your Killing Floor system folder.

Usage:
Set the minNumPlayers variable to whatever number you want between 1-100.  
The mutator will then scale every specimen's hp to that player count, 
regardless of how many living players there are.  Setting the player count 
beyond 6 will give the specimen's a slight boost in damage, 5% per player.  
Also, if the count is less than the number of living players, the hp will  
scale to the number of living players.
